// README FIRST!!!
//
// Due to a limitation in the sound emitter system that we shipped on PS3,
// the original sound scripts must NOT be changed after ship on PC/Mac
// until we can patch PS3 and fix the issue for real.
//
// You will get a fatal error on startup if you do so.
//
// If you need to add more sounds, you MUST add them to a NEW sound script file
// and reference that file at the BOTTOM of this list after the designated
// marker ("new_sound_scripts_must_go_below_here").
